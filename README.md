- 👋 Hi, I'm Rahman
- 👀 I'm interested in front-end development
- 🌱 I'm currently studying in the 11th grade, I'm preparing for the Unified State Examination, 
- I will take the computer science prof. mathematics, at the same time I understand that the university will not teach anything,
-  so in my free time I develop myself in programming. At the moment I'm learning HTML/CSS, and then I'm thinking JAVASCRIPT and the React library
- 💞️ Glad to meet new people
- 📫 How to contact me https://t.me/fiavok
